CommaParser
===========

This plugin allows you to accept commas from users for integer fields in 
an ActiveRecord model.


Example
=======

# Table name: cities
#
#  id           :integer(11)     not null, primary key
#  name         :string(50)
#  population   :integer(11)

class City < ActiveRecord::Base
  allow_commas :population


  # rest of class
end

Now the user can type population "1,000,000" into a form and it will still 
save correctly as "1000000" instead of "1". This saves you the hassle of stripping 
out commas either in JavaScript or in the controller.
